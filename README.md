# DPM_Unity_VR

Dual paraboloid mapping (DPM) is an approach for environment mapping that utilizes the reflection of two paraboloid surfaces. Compared to the popular cube mapping approach (CM), DPM offers a major advantage in terms of faster map generation speed. In this project, we implemented the Seamless Mipmap Filtering algorithm for DPM and compared it to CM in a VR platform (Oculus Quest 2) using Unity.
